sta_1	We accept improvements in the status and power of the lower classes without feeling morally offended.
sta_2	All men are expected to try to improve their position vis-a-vis others. 
sta_3	Success in life by a previously deprived person is resented.
sta_4	Men can expect, and within limits receive, fair treatment according to their merits.
sta_5	Lower-class individuals and groups do not have revolutionary inclinations.
sta_6	Political goals and methods are relatively moderate in this country -- and even conservative.
sta_7	We believe that those born to high place in society should retain it, more or less automatically.
sta_8	We take the view that anyone with wealth deserves a place in any high society if he wishes it.
sta_9	We try to eliminate the privileged classes in this country -- socially and economically.

sta_11	The government has its secrets, and this is generally accepted without much resentment.
sta_12	We place great emphasis on publicity in political matters: there should be no secrets.
sta_13	We are encouraged to think of ourselves as competing for success -- on our own merits.
sta_14	You can tell the social status of a person the moment he opens his mouth -- his manner of speech gives him away.
sta_15	We tend to take the law into our own hands, through mob action and the organization of vigilantes.

sta_22	Corrupt means of achieving success are accepted: for example, we put up with boss rule, and corruption in trade unions.

sta_24	Lack of respect for the police, and law enforcement is evident.
sta_25	Trust in the police has sunk deeply into our national character: basically we like and trust the police.
sta_26	The worth of a man is judged by what he is -- not by whether he has gone to a private college, a state university, or to neither.
sta_27	We have deep respect, when all is said and done, for the elite -- the rich, the educated, the social elite.

sta_29	We still believe that the poor on earth will enjoy higher status in after-life.
